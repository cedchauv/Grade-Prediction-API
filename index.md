## Introduction:



## Dataset:





The dataset contains 33 different variable columns, detailed below. Not all of these are useful for our project though, since they cant be applied to higher education. 





To be able to use this dataset with our neural network we have to do two things; Remove unnecessary columns, and replace non-integer values with binary integer values.

To be left with the useful columns, we run this code:

To replace string values with integer values, we run this:
<img src="images/replace.JPG" alt="code" class="inline"/>

These two together leaves us with a 'processed-tdata.csv' file that we can load with numpy!
