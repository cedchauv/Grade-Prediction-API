# Grade Prediction API

This is a three-man project for the courses Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Application, and possibly Database Systems, at Hanyang University, South Korea.

The project entails creating AI-software and related project documentation. (Proposal/Specification/Design/Implementation/etc)

For our project, we have decided to create an AI that predicts the grades of students based on many variables and factors.
